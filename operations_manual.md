## About
The group was set up in December 2017 by three people representing three different organisations (National Records of Scotland, National Services Scotland and Scottish Government). Since then we have held monthly meetings attended now by around 20 people and more organisations have joined in (NHS Health Scotland, Improvement service and Scottish Parliament Information Centre).
 
Meetings have been useful to discuss common issues and to help each other in an informal way and some guidelines have been created to ease the learning process for new users. The group is now considering to move to meetings every other month and to a more structured type of meeting where someone will present and lead on a specific topic discussion.
 
Some of the challenges this group is facing are:
Each organisation has different access to R versions and updates and has different restrictions to access the shinyapps.io server.
The expertise within each organisation is limited (although this group helps it to be galvanised). It might be a good idea to procure some advanced training for group members.

Hi all,

This is a reminder of our next meeting to be held on 25th July from 1-3 pm at Meridian Court (Glasgow).

Please fill in this form if you are interested in attending: https://goo.gl/forms/thYwiWXRgvsLBb2D3. The room can only hold 20 people, so first come, first served. Unless you are presenting something, then you’ll have a space for sure :).

Please see in the link below minutes from the last meeting and draft agenda for the next meeting: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-hf0jTUxqqQOXeSXhp0eH4bxgt5CDo6-wvTVNQ2aaUo

We would like this group to be run by its members, which relies on people getting interested and involved – to that end, if anyone wants to present their app to the group or discuss any topic, please get in touch. It would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
NAME
